        <h2>Kota</h2>
        <p>At the moment we only have Kota, our American Staffordshire Terrier</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>She is a handful. We rescued her in October of 2021 from 
          <a href="https://www.ophumanesociety.org/" target="_blank">Olympic Peninsula Humane Society</a> in Sequim, WA. She was brought north from a 
          California kill shelter. We believe she may have been a bait dog as her ears are cropped and she has some scarring on her head and muzzle.
          She is as lovey as can be with eyes that tell you you're the only person in the world.

        <h2>The Snakes</h2>
          <p>
            The snakes were a paradigm in the early '20's. The snakes, with the exception of the Kingsnakes, were rescues or rehomes from other owners.
            <a href="https://www.snakehaus.com/" target="_blank">Snake Haus</a> was the local shelter that I became familiar with and became the focus of my 
            philanthropy efforts for those years. The snakes became a reality immediately preceding moving into our own house. The phase was likely 
            due to <a href="#vanishing_snake">The Vanishing Snake</a> incident. The snakes were all eventually rehomed before moving cross country. 
            while this was hard at the time, it turned out to be a good idea because we were stranded in Arizona for 2 weeks during our move and because of 
            the circumstances, the physical stress may well have killed several of them. Instead we wished them well into several experienced reptile homes 
            and rescues.

        <h2>Olive</h2>
          <p>Olive was our normal type Ball Python</p>
          <img src="" alt="">
          <p>
            She was a mellow gal overall. Loved to climb at night and bang around. Could be held with an even temperament for as 
            long as desired. Enjoyed exploring the house on shoulders. Came to us from a friend rarely moving from her hide 
            and eating sporadically. Left an active social butterfly and a healthy eater.
